com.trx.neon.model.constraint

This package defines the transport classes for sending external constraints into the NeonLocationService.  
Since these are only transport classes, making changes here is likely to break compatibility with the NeonLocationService.

If you need to add a new Error Model to properly represent your constraint, please let TRX Systems know.
