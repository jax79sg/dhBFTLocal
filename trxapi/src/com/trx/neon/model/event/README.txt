com.trx.neon.model.event

This package defines the transport classes for receiving events from the NeonLocationService.  
Since these are transport classes, making any changes here is likely to break compatibility with the NeonLocationService.

If you're looking to receive notification for a new event type, please let TRX Systems know.
